Partitioning in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
===========================================

Partitioning in GCP refers to the practice of dividing large datasets into smaller, more manageable chunks based on specific criteria. This technique is primarily used in BigQuery (Google's data warehouse) and Cloud Storage to improve query performance and reduce costs.

BigQuery Partitioning
---------------------

BigQuery supports several types of partitioning:

### 1\. Time-unit partitioning

This is the most common type where tables are partitioned by:

-   Day (default)
-   Hour
-   Month
-   Year

**Example:**

```
CREATE TABLE mydataset.sales_by_day
PARTITION BY DATE(transaction_timestamp)
AS SELECT * FROM mydataset.sales;

```

This creates a table partitioned by day based on the transaction timestamp.

### 2\. Integer range partitioning

Tables are split based on integer ranges.

**Example:**

```
CREATE TABLE mydataset.customer_purchases
PARTITION BY RANGE_BUCKET(customer_id, GENERATE_ARRAY(0, 1000000, 10000))
AS SELECT * FROM mydataset.purchases;

```

This partitions data into ranges of 10,000 customer IDs.

### 3\. Ingestion-time partitioning

Tables are partitioned based on when data was loaded.

**Example:**

```
CREATE TABLE mydataset.logs
PARTITION BY _PARTITIONDATE
AS SELECT * FROM mydataset.raw_logs;

```

Benefits of BigQuery Partitioning
---------------------------------

1.  **Cost reduction**: When querying partitioned tables, BigQuery only processes the partitions that match your query filters, reducing the bytes processed and therefore the cost.

2.  **Performance improvement**: Queries run faster because they scan less data.

**Example of a query on a partitioned table:**

```
SELECT sum(revenue)
FROM mydataset.sales_by_day
WHERE DATE(transaction_timestamp)
BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-01-31';

```

This query only processes January 2025 data, not the entire table.


Partitioning vs. Clustering
---------------------------

In BigQuery, you can combine partitioning with clustering:

```
CREATE TABLE mydataset.sales_data
PARTITION BY DATE(transaction_date)
CLUSTER BY region, product_category
AS SELECT * FROM mydataset.raw_sales;

```

This partitions by date first, then organizes data within each partition by region and product category.

Clustering in BigQuery
======================

Clustering is a powerful table organization technique in BigQuery that complements partitioning. While partitioning divides your data into separate storage units based on partition columns, clustering organizes the data within each partition (or within the entire table if not partitioned) based on the contents of specified columns.

How Clustering Works
--------------------

When you cluster a table, BigQuery automatically organizes the data based on the values in your clustering columns. Similar values are physically stored together, which makes queries that filter or aggregate on these columns significantly more efficient.

Think of clustering as creating an automatic sorting of your data. If you cluster by "region," all data for "North America" will be stored together, followed by all data for "Europe," and so on.

Benefits of Clustering
----------------------

1.  **Improved query performance**: When you filter or aggregate on clustering columns, BigQuery can skip reading large portions of data.

2.  **Fine-grained organization**: You can specify up to four clustering columns, allowing for more detailed organization than partitioning alone.

3.  **Automatic maintenance**: Unlike traditional databases, BigQuery automatically re-clusters data as needed without manual intervention.

4.  **No limits on cardinality**: Unlike partitioning (which has a 4,000 partition limit), clustering works well for high-cardinality columns like user_id.

Creating Clustered Tables
-------------------------

### Creating a New Clustered Table

```
CREATE TABLE mydataset.sales_data
CLUSTER BY customer_region, product_category
AS SELECT * FROM mydataset.source_sales;

```

This creates a table clustered by customer region and then by product category within each region.

### Creating a Partitioned and Clustered Table

```
CREATE TABLE mydataset.daily_sales
PARTITION BY DATE(transaction_date)
CLUSTER BY store_id, product_id, transaction_id
AS SELECT * FROM mydataset.source_sales;

```

This creates a table partitioned by day and then clustered by store, product, and transaction ID within each day's partition.

### Creating an Empty Clustered Table with Schema

```
CREATE TABLE mydataset.user_events (
  user_id STRING,
  event_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  event_name STRING,
  value FLOAT64
)
CLUSTER BY user_id, event_name;

```

This creates an empty table that will cluster data by user ID and event name as data is loaded.

When to Use Clustering
----------------------

Clustering is particularly effective in these scenarios:

1.  **When your data has high cardinality columns** (too many unique values for effective partitioning)

2.  **When you commonly filter or aggregate on specific columns**

3.  **When you need multiple levels of organization** (up to 4 columns)

4.  **When your data is already partitioned**, but you need additional organization within partitions

Best Practices for Clustering
-----------------------------

1.  **Order your clustering columns strategically**: Place columns with higher cardinality (more unique values) after columns with lower cardinality.

2.  **Limit to 4 or fewer columns**: You can only specify up to 4 clustering columns.

3.  **Choose columns you frequently filter on**: The biggest performance benefits come when queries filter on clustering columns.

4.  **Consider combining with partitioning**: For large datasets, use partitioning for coarse division and clustering for fine-tuning.

Example Use Cases
-----------------

### Web Analytics

```
CREATE TABLE analytics.page_views
PARTITION BY DATE(view_date)
CLUSTER BY country, device_type, browser
AS SELECT * FROM analytics.raw_page_views;

```

This organization makes it efficient to analyze traffic patterns by country, device type, and browser for specific date ranges.

### E-commerce Transactions

```
CREATE TABLE sales.transactions
PARTITION BY DATE(transaction_date)
CLUSTER BY customer_id, product_category
AS SELECT * FROM sales.raw_transactions;

```

This structure optimizes for analyzing customer purchasing patterns within specific product categories over time.

Querying Clustered Tables
-------------------------

When querying clustered tables, include filters on the clustering columns when possible to maximize performance benefits:

```
-- Efficient query using clustering columns
SELECT SUM(revenue)
FROM sales.transactions
WHERE
  DATE(transaction_date) BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-01-31'
  AND customer_id = '12345'
  AND product_category = 'Electronics';

```

This query can efficiently leverage both partitioning (on transaction_date) and clustering (on customer_id and product_category).

Partitioning in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
===========================================

Partitioning in GCP refers to the practice of dividing large datasets into smaller, more manageable chunks based on specific criteria. This technique is primarily used in BigQuery (Google's data warehouse) and Cloud Storage to improve query performance and reduce costs.

BigQuery Partitioning
---------------------

BigQuery supports several types of partitioning:

### 1\. Time-unit partitioning

This is the most common type where tables are partitioned by:

-   Day (default)
-   Hour
-   Month
-   Year

**Example:**

```
CREATE TABLE mydataset.sales_by_day
PARTITION BY DATE(transaction_timestamp)
AS SELECT * FROM mydataset.sales;

```

This creates a table partitioned by day based on the transaction timestamp.

### 2\. Integer range partitioning

Tables are split based on integer ranges.

**Example:**

```
CREATE TABLE mydataset.customer_purchases
PARTITION BY RANGE_BUCKET(customer_id, GENERATE_ARRAY(0, 1000000, 10000))
AS SELECT * FROM mydataset.purchases;

```

This partitions data into ranges of 10,000 customer IDs.

### 3\. Ingestion-time partitioning

Tables are partitioned based on when data was loaded.

**Example:**

```
CREATE TABLE mydataset.logs
PARTITION BY _PARTITIONDATE
AS SELECT * FROM mydataset.raw_logs;

```

Benefits of BigQuery Partitioning
---------------------------------

1.  **Cost reduction**: When querying partitioned tables, BigQuery only processes the partitions that match your query filters, reducing the bytes processed and therefore the cost.

2.  **Performance improvement**: Queries run faster because they scan less data.

**Example of a query on a partitioned table:**

```
SELECT sum(revenue)
FROM mydataset.sales_by_day
WHERE DATE(transaction_timestamp)
BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-01-31';

```

This query only processes January 2025 data, not the entire table.

Cloud Storage Partitioning
--------------------------

While Cloud Storage doesn't have built-in partitioning like BigQuery, you can implement logical partitioning through object naming conventions:

**Example folder structure:**

```
gs://my-analytics-bucket/sales/year=2025/month=01/day=01/data.csv
gs://my-analytics-bucket/sales/year=2025/month=01/day=02/data.csv

```

This pseudo-partitioning allows tools like Dataflow, Dataproc, or BigQuery to more efficiently process only the relevant parts of your dataset.

Partitioning vs. Clustering
---------------------------

In BigQuery, you can combine partitioning with clustering:

```
CREATE TABLE mydataset.sales_data
PARTITION BY DATE(transaction_date)
CLUSTER BY region, product_category
AS SELECT * FROM mydataset.raw_sales;

```

This partitions by date first, then organizes data within each partition by region and product category.
